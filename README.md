# CS350
Course work for CS350 


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

For this class we were tasked with exploreing possible options for building out a smart thermostat with wifi capabilty useing already existing embedded architectures 

What did you do particularly well?

My strong suit tends to lean towards the technical work i am strong at writing well formated functional code so i felt like the software that i created for the controller of the thermostat was the well done portion of the project 

Where could you improve?

Haveing said i am good technically i tend to struggle with drawing of diagrams and other documetation that goes along with the actuall software to help others understand what i have done and why it is the way it is this is something i am actively chaseing improvments in.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

After this course i feel like ive learned alot about an area that i didnt have alot of practice in with embedded systems i dont know if it will help me in my carrer but i will never say any experince is bad im sure at some point i will be able to apply some of what i learned here. 

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made my code as maintainable as possible by writing well formated code with clear labels that are self explanatory where ever it was possible and where it was not i clearly labeled my functions with comments.
